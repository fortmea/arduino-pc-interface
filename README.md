# arduino-pc-interface
A basic pc to arduino interface made using C# 
It sends data via serial connection to the board for it to be displayed on a lcd, but it can be tweaked to do different tasks.
In the current state, it sends GPU, CPU, and RAM data. Altough the GPU part is a little glitchy, sometimes the use can go over 100%
